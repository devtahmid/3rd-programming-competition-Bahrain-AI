### Competition Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or size of land.

### Goal
It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.
